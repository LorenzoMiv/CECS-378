- front end of comic book webpage doesn't have permissions to do anything outside of it's ui, 
  so it cannot write to the files, when you are trying to delete it will not actually delete
- Local IP address is accessed by using Surge, which allows you to have control of the network traffic, 
  that means incoming and outgoing requests to users machine
	- can have rules set up: when a process from Firefox initiates a process, it routes through a proxy, 
	  which forwards request, and allows to remote into home computer with ssh 
	- creates a mini tunnel that uses ssh to route certain traffic 
	- ask about setting this up 
	- any inputs that you can't confirm are threats to your system so we want to make sure that the pieces are separate 
	- attack surfaces

Lecture Notes: 
	- Mobile Phone Worms
		- First discover was Cabir worm in 2004
			- would scan for more blue tooth devices and would send itself there (propagation) 
			- would also attempt to call or message contacts within your phone
			- only infected devices that used Symbian (Nokia's OS)
		- Then Lasco and CommWarrior in 2005 
		- Communicate through bluetooth wireless connections or MMS
		- Can completely disable the phone, delete data on the phone, 
		  or force the device to send costly messages
		- CommWarrior replicates by means of Bluetooth to other phones, sends itself as an 
		  MMS file to contacts and as an auto reply to incoming text messages
			** side notes **
			- blue tooth acted as a proximity transfer file and lacked security
			- needed device ID but there was no verification 
			- if you have device ID you can send to that device, and you can scan public places 
	- Mobile code: 
		- Programs that can be shipped unchanged to a variety of platforms
		- transmitted from a remote system to a local system and then executed on the local system
		- often acts as a mechanism for a virus, worm, or trojan horse
		- takes advantage of vulnerabilities to perform its own exploits 
		- popular vehicles java applets, activeX, javascript, python, ruby, and VBscript 
		  (all interpreted and heavyweight because it requires a lot of resources) 
			** side notes ** 
			- worms seek to have mobile code 
			- compiled is device specific and uses local libraries and is specific for an architecture 
			- interpreter is the piece that has been coded for that machine and that reviews the source code and runs the code for the machine it is running on 
	- Drive-By-Downloads
		- Exploits browser vulnerabilities to download and installs malware on the system when the user views a web page controlled by the attacker
		- In most cases does not actively propagate
		- spreads when users visit the malicious web page 
			** side notes**
	- Click Jacking
		- UI redress attack, using similar technique, keystrokes can also be hijacked 
			- users can be tricked into entering text/passwords into an invisible frame that is overlaying standard GUI input boxes
			- Attackers can also use remapped UI buttons or controls in order to trick a user into clicking the wrong dialog box  
			** side notes **
			- any pop up script that is run on pay walled sites 
			- we can use no script to bypass this, there are browser plugins, we can clear cookies, browse privately
	- Social Engineering: 
		- Using social norms and mores in order to convince a user to compromise their own systems or data 
			- spam 
				- yes, this is considered a form of social engineering 
			- trojan horses
				- possibly the most common form of social engineering with malware
