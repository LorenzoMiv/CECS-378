Maleware: A program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or
	      availability of the victim's data, applications, or operating system or otherwise annoying or disrtupting the victim. 
	Types of Malicious Software (Malware):
		- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT): persistently and effectively applied to specific targets over an extended period, 
		often attributed to state-sponsored organizations
		- Adware: Advertising that is integrated into software, pop-up or browser redirection
		- Attack Kit: tools for generating new malware automatically using a variety of propogation and payload mechanisms
		- Auto-rooter: Malicious hacker tools used to break into new machines remotely
		- Backdoor: mechanism that bypasses a normal security check
		- Downloaders: Code that installs other items on a machine that is under attack
		- Drive-by download: code on a compromised website that exploits a browser vulnerability to attack a client system when 
		the site is viewed
		- Exploits: Code specific to a single vulnerability or set 
		- Flooders (DoS client): Generate large volume of data to attack networked computer systems
		- Keyloggers: Captures keystrokes on a compromised system
		- Logic Bomb: A logic bomb that lies dormany until a predefined condition is met; the code then triggers some payload
		- Macro Virus: uses macro or scripting code, typically embedded in a document or document template, and triggered when the 
		document is viewed or edited, to run and replicate itself into other documents
		- Mobile code: software that can be shipped unchanged to a heterogeneous collection of platforms and execute identical 
		semantics
		- Rootkit: Set of hacker tools used after attacker has broken into a computer system and gained root-level access
		- Spammer programs: users to send large volumes of unwated e-mail
		- Spyware: Collects information from a computer and transmits it to another system by monitoring keystrokes, screen data, 
		network traffic, or by scanning files for sensitive information
		- Trojan Horse: computer program that appears to have a useful function, but has a hidden and potentially malicious function 
		that evades security mechanisms, sometime exploiting legitimate authorizations
		- Virus: tries to replcate itself into other executable machine script code, when infected code executes so does the virus
		- Worm: A computer program that can run independently and can propagate a complete working version of itself onto other 
		hosts on a network, by exploiting software vulnerabilities in the target system
		- Zombie: Program installed on an infected machine that is activated to launch attacks on other machines
	Broad Classification of Malware: 
		- Propogation: how the malware reaches its desired target
			- Mechanisms: 
				- infection of existing executable or interpreted content by viruses that is spread over other systems
				- exploit of software vulnerabilities either locally or over a network by worms or drive-by-downloads
				- social engineering attacks to get users to bypass security mechanisms 
		- Payload: actions performed once the target is reached
			- Includes:
				- corruption of system or data files
				- theft of service in order to make the system a zombie agent 
				- theft of information from the system
				- stealthing where the malware hides its presence on the system from attempts to detect and block it
		- Blend attack: multiple methods of infection or propogation to maximize the speed of contagion and the severity
		Attack Kits: 
			- Crimeware: variety of propogation mechanisms and payload modules that can be combined, selected, and deployed.
				- can include latest vulnerabilities 
		Attack Sources: 
			- More organized groups of people that are working together for one malicious objective
	Advanced Persistent Threat:
			- Are careful in their target selection, persistent, often stealthy, and intrusive effort over extended periods 
			- Characteristics: 
				Advanced:  wide variety of intrusion technologies and malware, including custom malware if required,
				 also carefully selected to suit the chosen target
				Persistent: Attacks over an extended period against the chosen target in order to maximize the chance 
				of success
				Threats: active involvement of people in the process greatly raises the threat level and increases success
			- Difficult to defend against due to the specific and persistent targeting
	Propagation - Infected content - Viruses: 
		Nature of Viruses: 
			- piece of software that can "infect" other programs, by modifying original code with a routine to 
			make copies of the virus code
			- carries instructional code for making perfect copies of itself
			- whenever the infected computer comes into contact with an unifected piece of code, 
			a fresh copy passes to the new location and can be done with programs, files, usb sticks or over a network
			- executable viruses can do anything that the program is permitted to do with current user permissions
			- Macro viruses exploit the active content supported by some document types
			- Computer Virus states:
				1) Infection mechanism: how the virus spreads or propogates, enabling it to replicate (infection vector)
				2) Trigger: event or condition that determines when the payload is activated or delivered (logic bomb)
				3) Payload: what the virus does, besides spreading. May involve damage or benign but noticable activity
			- Virus Lifetime Phases: 
				1) Dormant Phase: Virus is idle, but not all have this stage
				2) Propagation Phase: virus places a copy of itself into other progams or into certain system areas on the disk,
				sometimes morphing to evade detection
				3) Triggering Phase: Virus is activated to perform the function for which it was intended, 
				and caused by a variety of events
				4) Execution phase: The function is performed, may be harmless or damaging
			- Viruses that infect executable programs are OS specific and sometimes hardware specific
		Macro and Scripting Viruses: 
			- Macro virus: virus that attaches to documents and uses the macro programming capabilities of the document's 
			application to execute and propagate
			- Threatful in 5 ways: 
				1) Platform independent, infect active content in commonly used applications
				2) Infect documents, not executable portions of code, which is how most information is introduced to a system, 
				rather than a program
				3) can easily spread, because they are utilizing something that is used very frequently
				4) traditional file system access controls are limited use in preventing their spread
				5) easier to write or modify than traditional executable viruses
		Macro Virus Structure: 
			- Macros can perform a wide range of operations, not just only on the document content, but can read and write files, 
			and call other applications
			- Some advanced macros may use stealth techniques like encryption or polymorphism
		Viruses Classification: 
			- Traget Classification categories: 
				1) Boot sector infector: infects a master boot record or boot record and spreads when a system is booted from 
				the disk containing the virus
				2) File Infector: Infects files that the OS or shell consider to be executable
				3) Macro Virus: Infects files with macro or scripting code that is interpreted by an application
				4) Multipartite virus: infects files in muliple ways, typically capable of infecting multiple types of files,
				so eradication must deal with all of the possible sites of infection
			- Concealed Classification Categories: 
				1) Encrypted Virus: a virus that uses encryption to obscure it's content
					- a key is created and stored with the virus
					- uses the stored random key decrypt the virus
					- when replicated a different random key is selected 
				2) Stealth Virus: designed to hide itself from detection by anti-virus software, the entire virus is hidden, 
				and may use code mutation, compression, or rootkit techniques
				3) Polymorphic Virus: Creates copies during replication that are functionally equivalent 
				but have distinctly different bit patterns. 
					- virus' "signature" will vary with each copy
					- the mutation engine (responsible for generating encrpytion/decrpytion keys) is altered after each use
					if encryption is used
				4) Metamorphic virus: mutates with every infection, rewrites itself completely at each iteration, 
				using multiiple transformation techniques 
					- may change their appearane and behavior
		
	Propogation - Vulnerability Exploit - Worms: 
		- Worm: program that actively seeks out more machines to infect, and then each infected machine serves as an automated
		launching pad for attacks on the other machines
		- Can spread through a network connection, or USB drives or CD and DVD data disks
		- Worm Replication: 
			1) Electronic mail or instant messenger facility: A worm e-mails a copy of itself to other systems, 
			or sends itself as an attachment via an instant message service launching when the content is received or viewed
			2) File Sharing: creates a copy of itself or infects other suitable files as a virus on removable media, 
			then executes when the drive is connected to another system using the autorun mechanism by exploiting some software
			3) Remote execution capability: copies itself on another system, either by using an explicit remote execution facility 
			or by exploiting a program flaw in a network service to subvert its operations 
			4) Remote login capability: worm logs onto a remote system as a user and then uses commands 
			to copy itself from one system to the other, where it then executes
		- Worms usually use the same phases as a virus: dormant, propagation, triggering, and execution
			- Propagation is a bit different:
				- searches for appropriate access mechanisms on other systems to infect by examining host tables, 
				address books, buddy lists, trusted peers and other remote access details
				- use the access mechanisms found to transfer a copy of itself to the remote system, 
				and cause the copy to run
		Target Discovery: 
			- Scanning: when a work searches for other systems to infect
			- Network Address Scanning: 
				1) Random: each compromised host probes random address in the IP address space, creates high network traffic
				2) Hit-List: attacker compiles a long list of potential vulnerable machines, once on a machine a portion of the 
				list is scanned, which makes the process very quick and hard to detect 
				3) Topological: uses informtion contained on an infected victim machine to find more hosts to scan 
				4) Local subnet: if a host can be infected behind a firewall, 
				that host then looks for targets in its own local network
		State of Worm Technology: 
			1) Multiplatform: newer worms are not limited to windows machines but can attack a variety of platforms
			2) Mult-exploit: penetrate systems in a variety of ways, using exploits against web servers, browsers, email, file sharing, 
			and network-based applications
			3) ultrafast spreading: exploit various techniques to optimize the rate of spread of a worm to maximize
			 its likelihood of locating as many vulnerable machines as possible in a short time
			4) polymorphic: evade detection, skip past filters, and foil real-time analysis, each copy has new code on the fly
			5) Metamorphic: change appearance and behavior
			6) Transport vehicle: ideal for spreading a wide variety of malicios payloads, such as distributed DoS bots, rootkits,
			 spam email generators, and spyware
			7) zero-day exploit: exploit an unkown vulnerability that is only discovered by the general network community when the 
			worm is launched 
		Mobile Code: 
			- Transmitted from a remote system to a local system then executed on the local system without the user's instruction
		Mobile Phone Worms: 
			- communicate through bluetooth wireless connections or via the multimedia messaging service
			- the vast majority of mobile phone malware observed use trojan apps to install themselves
		Client-side Vulnerabilities and Drive-by-dowloads:
			- Drive-by-download: webpage controlled by an attacker will use exploits in the browser to download and 
			install malware without the users knowledge or consent
			- Watering-hole attacks: attacker researches their intended victims to identify websites they are likely to visit, 
			then scan these sites to identify those with vulnerabilities that allow their compromise with a dbd attack, 
			attackers may also specify the target and not impact other users
			- Malvertising: places malware on websites without actually compromising them, attacker pays for ads that are highly 
			likely to be plaaced on their intended target websites, and incorporate malware in them
		Clickjacking: 
			- User-interface redress attack: vulnerability used by an attacker to collect an infected user's clicks 
				- attacker can force the user to do a variety of things by doing something like putting an overlay on a button
				- this can also be done with keystrokes by using fake boxes for login information
	Propagatinion-Social Engineering-Spam Email, Trojans:
		- Tricking the user to assist in the compromise of their own systems or personal information
		Spam (Unsolicited Bulk) E-mail:
			- Some spam email is sent from legitimate mail servers using stolen user credentials, 
			most recent spam is sent by botnets using compromised user systems
			- spam emails occassionally have attachments that seek to exploit software
		Trojan Horses: 
			- useful, or apparently useful, program or utility containing hidden code that performs some unwaned or hamful fucntion
			- Three models:
				1) Continuing to perform the function of the original program and additionally performing a separate malicious 
				activity
				2) continuing to perform the function of the original program but modifying the function to perfom malicious 
				activity or to disguise malicious activity
				3) performing a mlaicious function that completely replaces the function of the original program 
		Mobile Trojans: 
			- Trojans are usually distributed via one or more of the app marketplaces for the target phone OS 
	Payload - System Corruption: 
		Data Destruction and Ransomware: 
			- Ransomware: when a user's data is encrypted and payment is demanded for key access
				- is often spread via "drive-by-downloads" or spam emails
			- Data destruction is a key motivation for a lot of malware, usually laying dormany until some trigger happens 
		Logic Bomb: 
			- Logic Bomb: code embedded in the malware that is set to explode when certain conditions are met
			- once triggered the bomb may alter or delete data or entire files causing the machine to halt or do some damage
	6.7 Payload - Attack Agent - Zombie, Bots
