    "        - Denial of Service: An action that prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, \n",
    "        or applications by exhausting resources such as CPU, memory, bandwidth, and disk space. \n",
    "            - Resources attacked: \n",
    "                1) Network Bandwidth \n",
    "                    - Flooding: Traffic overwhelms any legitimate traffic, effectively denying legitimate users\n",
    "                2) System Resources\n",
    "                    - Specific packets may be sent to limit resouces available on the system\n",
    "                    - Poison Packet: uses packets whose structure triggers a bug in the system's network handling\n",
    "                    software\n",
    "                3) Application Resources\n",

    "            requests to the smaller network and flood the network flow because it cannot handle the large amount\n",
    "            of requests \n",

    "            connection requests by overflowing the tables used to manage such connections\n",

    "        - Flood a network link to a server with a torrent of malicious packets competing with valid traffic\n",
    "        - Common flooding uses ICMP, UDP, or TCP SYN\n",
    "        -ICMP Flood: \n",

    "        - UDP Flood: \n",
    "            - User Datagram Protocol packets directed to some port number, and hence potential service\n",
    "        - TCP SYN Flood: \n",
    "            - total volume of packets rather than the system code like SYN spoofing\n",
    "            - Sends massive numbers of SYN requests to a server to overwhelm it with open connections\n",
