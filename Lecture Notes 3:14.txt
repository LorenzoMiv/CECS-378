Lecture Notes: 
	- Worms: 
		- Actively seek out more machines to infect and each infected machine serves as an automated launching pad for additional attacks
		- Exploits software vulnerabilities in client or server programs
		- can use the network connections to spread from system to system 
		- spreads through shared media (USB drives, CD, DVD data disks)
		- email worms spread in macro or script code included in attachments and instant messenger file transfers 
		- upon activation the worm may replicate and propagate again
		- first known implementation was done in Xerox Palo Alto Labs in early 80s (created GUI's, mouse pointer, mouse, windows) 
			** side notes ** 
			- star that shines super bright and then dies out really quickly (analogy) 
			- viruses spread a lot slower but are hard to get rid of, whereas worms are typically fairly easy to remove because of their lack of hardening
			- worms can be in discord, YouTube links, things like that 
			- commercial software was the most common way to get infected with software before 2010
				- if the main computer that created the software was infected it would send out the infection on CDs to others that would be initialized on home computers 
			- nowadays more commonly done through some type of chat, social media, and such
	- Worm Replication:  
		- Email or instant messaging 
		- File sharing 
		- Remote execution 
		- Remote file transfer (FTP, SFTP)
		- Remote Login (vnc, ssh) 
	- Target Discovery: 
		- Called scanning or fingerprinting where a worm attempts to find other systems to infect 
			- random
			- hit-list:  a list of computers that you definitely want to hit (predetermined)
			- topological: uses information that is inferred to find other machines using the operating system, uses the host file (lets you localize your own DNS service) 
			- local subnet 
	- Worm Technology: 	
		- Multiplatform: attempt to work on any Operating System, whereas viruses are not good at this 
		- Metamorphic: biggest threat, they can change their internal structure and way they operate based on their operating environment
			- if it's on a MacOS system and then gets to a Windows OS there is an attack plan 
		- Polymorphic: can change itself to better attack the operating system 
		- Multiple exploits: 
	- Case Study: Morris Worm
		- First computer worm created by Robert Morris in '88, "Great internet worm"
		- intended to determine the size of the internet of the day by spreading across machine and probing their networks 
		- designed to spread on UNIX systems
			- attempted to crack local password file to use login/password to log in to other systems
			- exploited a bug in the finger protocol (query a different user on the network, requested information about the user) which reports the whereabouts of a remote user
			- exploited a trapdoor in the debug option of the remote process that receives and sends mail
			** side notes **
			- was intentionally small
			- four different ways to try and get into the machine, hoping that one would work 
			- the first would spread, and infect once it went back to another machine, so if the worm reports back to another one, previously infected machine, 
			it gets the worm a second time, and continues any time that it is referenced 
		- Coding error caused the worm to self-replicate multiple times on a single computer and crash the machine 
		- caused an estimated 1 million in damages and lost computing time (internet was down for a week)
